FRONTEND PROJECT -- FOREIGN SERVICE FINDER

I have created this site for the purpose of completing the milestone project
 of frontend design. I have added or ammended the html, css, and java plug ins.
 
The idea behind the page, is simply a service that can be utilized to find 
various foreign auto service centers. I have created basic services that 
would be completed at generic mileage intervals. The map data and marker 
locations have simply been re-utilized on each brand page. I only did this to 
indicate my ability to create and utilize the technology.

The bootstrap, css, and java files that were utilized are as follows:

bootstrap:
    basic site layout, grid system, and containers

css/font-awesome:
    CSS stylings mainly just modified and customized from the teachings through-
    out the module. 
    Font-Awesome stylings for fonts utilized.

All map data was tested, the email function was never fully set up but will 
refresh the page when used. The responsive designe was checked and tested across
mulitple platforms such as: iPhone X, iPad Air, MacBook Air
